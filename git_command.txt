git init
Initializes a git repository – creates the initial ‘.git’ directory in a new or in an existing project. 
Example: cd /home/user/my_new_git_folder/ git init

git clone
Makes a Git repository copy from a remote source. 
Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions. 
Example: git clone git@github.com:user/test.git

git add
Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. 
Example: git add .

git rm
Removes files from your index and your working directory so they will not be tracked. 
Example: git rm filename

git commit
Takes all of the changes written in the index, creates a new commit object pointing to it 
and sets the branch to point to that new commit. 
Examples: git commit -m ‘committing added changes’ 
git commit -a -m ‘committing all changes, equals to git add and git commit’

git status
Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. 

git pull
Fetches the files from the remote repository and merges it with your local one. 
This command is equal to the git fetch and the git merge sequence. Example: git pull origin

git push
Pushes all the modified local objects to the remote repository and advances its branches.
 Example: git push origin master

git remote
Shows all the remote versions of your repository.
 Example: git remote origin

git log
Shows a listing of commits on a branch including the corresponding details. 
Example: git log commit 84f241e8a0d768fb37ff7ad40e294b61a99a0abe Author: User <user@domain.com> Date: Mon May 3 09:24:05 2010 +0300 first commit
